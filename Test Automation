Test automation

1. Through unit testing mocked configurations the game can run.

2. Through mocking out the configurations an automation can create.

3. Tack Through the 10 x10 grid and the operating commands the drone will understand with exact definition of it's current location in the grid.

4. The primary command is placed command state before it there's no command that will be executable.

5. THrough loops set a limiting range so the drone only moves within the grid.

6. The drone is limited to move in the context of the 10 x 10 grid. 
    There's no other command that can execute without the drone bing placed first.
    It only enforces that the user place the drone before executing any other move.
